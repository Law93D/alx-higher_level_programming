## Tasks Overview

The tasks included in this project cover various aspects of JavaScript programming, including variable declaration, conditional statements, loops, functions, and object manipulation. Each task has specific requirements and objectives to fulfill.

## Task Descriptions

1. **First constant, first print:** Create a constant variable and print a message using `console.log()`.
2. **3 languages:** Print three lines of text using `console.log()`.
3. **Arguments:** Print a message based on the number of arguments passed to the script using `process.argv`.
4. **Value of my argument:** Print the first argument passed to the script.
5. **Create a sentence:** Print two arguments passed to the script in a specific format.
6. **An Integer:** Print a message based on whether the first argument can be converted to an integer.
7. **Loop to languages:** Print three lines using a loop and an array of strings.
8. **I love C:** Print a message a certain number of times based on the first argument passed to the script.
9. **Square:** Print a square of a specified size using 'X' characters.
10. **Add:** Print the addition of two integers using a defined function.
11. **Factorial:** Compute and print the factorial of a given integer using recursion.
12. **Second biggest!:** Find and print the second biggest integer in a list of arguments.
13. **Object:** Modify the value of a property within an object.
14. **Add file:** Write a function that returns the addition of two integers, visible from outside.
15. **Const or not const:** Modify the value of a variable.
16. **Call me Moby:** Execute a given function a certain number of times.
17. **Add me maybe:** Increment a number and call a function.
18. **Increment object:** Add a method to an object that increments its value.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory
- Code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x)
- All files must be executable

## How to Run

To execute each script, you can use the following command format:
